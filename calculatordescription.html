        <h1 style="text-align:center">Programming Calculator</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The "Programming Calculator" is a comprehensive web application designed to assist with various mathematical and programming-related calculations. This tool is useful for programmers and developers who need to perform both basic arithmetic and bitwise operations. The calculator includes functionality for common arithmetic, prime checking, factorial calculation, square roots, and several bitwise operations.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b> Basic Arithmetic: </b>Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations.</li>
            <li><b>Bitwise Operations: </b>Includes bitwise AND, OR, XOR, NOT, LEFT SHIFT, and RIGHT SHIFT operations.</li>
            <li><b>Special Functions: </b>Offers functionality for calculating factorials, checking for prime numbers, and computing square roots.</li>
            <li><b> Interactive Interface: </b>User-friendly interface with clickable buttons and keyboard support for quick input.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Use</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the Programming Calculator application in your web browser.</li>
            <li>Use the numeric buttons or your keyboard to input numbers.</li>
            <li>Click on the operation buttons or use the keyboard to perform the desired calculation.</li>
            <li>View the result in the display area at the top of the calculator.</li>
            <li>Use the CE (Clear Entry) button to clear the current input or the Back button to delete the last digit entered.</li>
            <li>Click on the "=" button or press Enter to display the result of the calculation.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>HTML & CSS: </b>Used for structuring and styling the application.</li>
            <li><b>JavaScript: </b>Implements the logic for all arithmetic, special, and bitwise operations.</li>
            <li><b>Responsive Design: </b>Ensures the application works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Developing the "Programming Calculator" was an enriching experience, enhancing my skills in web development, particularly in creating interactive and functional user interfaces. The project aims to provide a useful tool for programmers and developers who require quick and easy access to various mathematical operations. I hope you find this application helpful and look forward to your feedback.</p>
