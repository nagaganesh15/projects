        <h1 style="text-align:center">Stone Paper Scissor</h1>
        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>I recently developed a web-based Rock Paper Scissors game. This project allowed me to enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and create an engaging and interactive user experience. Below are the key features and functionalities of the game.</p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>Interactive UI:</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The game has a visually appealing user interface with background images and buttons that change appearance when hovered over.</li>
                <li>Users can easily select their moves (stone, paper, or scissors) with corresponding buttons.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><h3>Level Selection:</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Players can choose the number of rounds they want to play from a dropdown menu.</li>
                <li>Options range from 5 to 50 rounds, providing flexibility for different game lengths.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li><h3>Gameplay:</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The game displays the user's and computer's choices with images.</li>
                <li>Results of each round (win, lose, draw) are shown immediately.</li>
                <li>The score is updated dynamically after each round.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><h3>Scoreboard:</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>A scoreboard tracks the scores of both the user and the computer.</li>
                <li>The game announces the winner and updates the background image accordingly when the chosen level is reached.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><h3>Restart Functionality:</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Users can restart the game at any time, resetting the scores and level selection.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>User Interface: </b>The game interface is centered within a styled div box, providing a clear and structured layout.</li>
            <li><b>Level Selection: </b>Upon selecting a level, the game begins counting rounds.</li>
            <li><b>Player Moves: </b>Players click on the stone, paper, or scissors buttons to make their move. The computer's move is randomly generated.
            </li>
            <li><b>Result Calculation: </b>The game logic determines the winner of each round and updates the results and scores.</li>
            <li><b>End of Game: </b>When the user's or computer's score reaches the selected level, the game announces the winner and updates the background image to indicate the result.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>HTML:</b> For structuring the game layout.</li>
            <li><b>CSS: </b>For styling the game elements, including buttons, images, and the overall layout.</li>
            <li><b>JavaScript:</b> For handling game logic, user interactions, and dynamic updates.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This Rock Paper Scissors game project was a fun and educational experience. It helped me improve my coding skills and understand how to create a complete interactive application. I hope you enjoy playing it as much as I enjoyed making it!</p>
